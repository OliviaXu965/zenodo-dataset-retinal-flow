NOTE: change path in config to data path (uploaded via Dryad)

processed data (histograms generated under different conditions) are provided in figureDataSources.


However these can be regenerated with the following scripts:
- quantile_based_eye_dir_effects.m
- recomputeHistAll_mesh_orig_masks.m
- recomputeHistAll_mesh_orig_masks_saccades.m
- resamp_orig_hists.m

Will write .mat files into figureDataSources

one sample trial is included (sample_trial.mat), this is used for simulation code (simulateSlip.m)

To generate figures, run allFigures.m
